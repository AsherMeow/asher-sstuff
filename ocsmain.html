                <p>
                    Incase you have not noticed, this page is much more simple than the home page, and it's a completely different link(if you came from Neocities).<br>
                    This is because I knew this part would be much more heavy with data, from pictures to whole written documents.<br>
                    I have many OCs and I am uncapable to figure out how many I'll continue to make even if I dont update this page as often as I may wish.. <br>
                    Either way these pages are all just for fun, were created out of my boredom and from a person who takes joy of creating things wherever they can. <br>
                    Now that I think about it I didn't really explain why this page is more basic design wise... <br>
                    I wish that each of my OCs have their own little customised page!<br>
                    It could be different to whether how they would make their own page, or what they enjoy, personality, aesthethics, etc.<br>
                    I understand that I could do this all in ToyHouse.. but what's the fun in it?<br>
                    Oh yeah and we can't forget...<br><br>
                    <span class="warning">It will be YOUR responsibility if you see something that could make you uncomfortable...</span><br>
                    As a sensible human being I will put what content could be triggering to some people, and if I ever forget to put a certain subject, <br>
                    Just click the top of the page where there's a button saying " &#x21e6; Go back ".<br>
                    Click on one of any of my socials to contact me and warn that I forgot/did not put a certain trigger.<br>
                    But that's the only moment I will be responsibile when it comes to the warnings.<br><br>
                    Another warning though, which is my boundaries.. <br>
                    <span class="warning">DO NOT SEXUALIZE ANY OF MY OCS</span><br>
                    Any drawings or comments that could be considered sexualizing, ask for my permission first.<br>
                    Please <strong>check</strong> the character's age first before asking, if the character <strong>looks, acts or is a child don't even dare to ask.</strong><br>
                    I will say again, <strong>check before asking</strong>, if you can't tell or there's nothing about them that could represent a child, do not be afraid to ask.<br>
                    And when it comes to gore don't worry about it, aslong there's some warning of course.<br><br>
                    <strong>All art is made by me, if not there will be the credits on the bottom, right corner of the picture or in the picture itself</strong><br><br>
                    Thank you for reading the whole text, or atleast the parts that were important.
